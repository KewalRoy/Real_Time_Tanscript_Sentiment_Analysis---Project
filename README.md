# Real-Time Transcript Analysis using NLP
Hi I made this project during my industrial training with <b> KVCH.in 
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Ms. Ruby mam and Mr. Azmat Siddique sir (Machine Learning Engineer | Google Cloud Certified Data Engineer | Google Certified Tensorflow Developer). I got to learn a lot during this training and it was an amazing experience learning with KVCH.in
<br>

Real-Time Transcript Data Analysis is a ML modal who analysis the data (comedianâ€™ transcript) and then provide our meaningful data from the transcript that is bad words (vulgar language).<br>
In this modal we are providing the data to modal with the help of url links of transcripts and then we train the modal for some bad words like shit, fuck etc. After that the modal read the data from url links and check that who comedian use more bad words in own transcript. And compare with all comedians on the basis of bad words with the help of graph.<br>
This modal is based on NLP (Natural Language Processing) in Machine Learning and many python libraries and packages.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Machine Learning
<li>Data Science
<li>Data Visualization
<li>Data Mining
<li>Matplotlib
<li>Pandas
<li>Numpy
<li>Seaborn 
<li>Tensorflow and may more.
<br>during these days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these days.
