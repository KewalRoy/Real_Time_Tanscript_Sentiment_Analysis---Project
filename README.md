# Real-Time Transcript Analysis using NLP
Hi I made this project during my industrial training with <b> KVCH.in 
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Ms. Ruby mam and Mr. Azmat Siddique sir (Machine Learning Engineer | Google Cloud Certified Data Engineer | Google Certified Tensorflow Developer). I got to learn a lot during this training and it was an amazing experience learning with KVCH.in
<br>
<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Machine Learning
<li>Data Science
<li>Data Visualization
<li>Data Mining
<li>Matplotlib
<li>Pandas
<li>Numpy
<li>Seaborn 
<li>Tensorflow and may more.
<br>during these days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these days.
